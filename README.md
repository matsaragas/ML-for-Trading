### Fundamentals Used:

* **Market Cap**: The total value of its outstanding shares of stocks. It provides a measure 
of a company's overall worth as perceived by the stock market. 
  Market Cap is calculated as: `Market Cap = Share Price x Number of outstanding shares`,
  where outstanding share is the total number of shares currently held by 
shareholders, including institutional investors and company insiders.

* **Trailing P/E** (Price-to-Earnings Ratio) is a valuation metric that 
compares a company's current stock price to its earnings per share (EPS)
  over the past 12 months (trailing 12 months)
  `Traling PE = current stock price / EPS over the last 12 months`. It provides insights into how much investors are willing to pay each 
  for each dollar of earnings the company generated in the past
